# davidtw.co
My new, improved personal website featuring projects, writings and a personal wiki (just notes and stuff, nothing *that* interesting). Built using Metalsmith and deployed on Netlify.

I wanted to make something that was simple, fast and low maintenance while still being flexible enough to be built upon in future.

## How does this all work then?
Here's a [link to the website in this repository's post](https://davidtw.co/writings/2017/rebuilding-my-portfolio/) describing how I made this.

## How do I get it running?
If you want to run this website locally, you'll need to start by cloning the repository; then you'll have to install all the dependencies of the website (assuming you already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed); after that, you can just run the serve command and visit the website at `localhost:3000`:

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/davidtwco/personal-website.git
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```
