Currently a Software Engineering Undergraduate at the [University of Glasgow](https://gla.ac.uk) and a Integrations Engineer at [Codeplay Software](https://www.codeplay.com/). With lots of experience specializing in DevOps, I thrive combining software engineering expertise with operations knowledge to build maintainable, elegant solutions to problems. I enjoy solving challenging problems, working on systems that are complex in interesting ways and learning new technologies and tools - particularly interested in working on compilers in future.
