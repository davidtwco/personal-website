I was contracted to complete an incomplete shop floor information system - MIDAS. An ASP.NET system (in C#) which is the backbone of Polaroid Eyewear's manufacturing. I worked within the structure of the IT team, this involved interacting with the final users to define new features and enhancements. MIDAS went live in September 2014 with excellent user feedback.

In 2015/2016, I worked on creating an updated modern website for Polaroid Eyewear's 10K Race Series - this e-commerce website allowed runners to enter any of the four races in the Series - in March 2016 the website launched to great feedback and we saw an increase in runners and in charitable donations while saving money on payment processing costs.
