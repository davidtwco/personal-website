I was asked to create a informational landing page for West Dunbartonshire Leisures 10K race series - a continuation of Polaroid Eyewears series.

This involved working closely with the team at WDL to refine the needs of the website and then to build a functional, easy-to-use and easy-to-update website. Performance was an important consideration, and time was spent to ensure the website was fast and would require little maintenance. It launched to great user feedback in February of 2017.
