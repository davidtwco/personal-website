During the summer of 2017, I interned as a Build Engineer in Codeplay's Integrations team. I worked on improvements to the tooling surrounding Codeplay's build infrastructure. Over the course of the four months, I implemented vast changes to the infrastructure that reduced re-provisioning costs and improved the flexibility and extensiblity of the provisioning tooling. I also made various improvements to other internal tools used by the development teams.
