During the summer of 2015, I built and designed a fully-featured web-based Inventory Manager system and a suite of desktop applications for tracking the performance of the Warehouse.

Both projects required independence and coordination with other departments and employees. These well-designed applications released on schedule with brilliant feedback from users.
