I'm currently an Integrations Engineer at Codeplay. This involves the creation and configuration of tooling for automation and improvement of Codeplay's build infrastructure. It requires working closely with the development and infrastructure teams. I employ a combination of software engineering knowledge with operations knowledge to find solutions that increase developer productivity while minimizing downtime and maintenance requirements.
