I was contracted to complete an incomplete shop floor information system - MIDAS. An ASP.NET system (in C#) which is the backbone of Polaroid Eyewears manufacturing. I worked within the structure of the IT team, this involved interacting with the final users to define new features and enhancements. MIDAS went live in September 2014 with excellent user feedback.
