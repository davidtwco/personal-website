During my summer placement at Glasgow Caledonian University, I implemented a program that uses the process of Non-Photorealistic Rendering to make an image look less realistic - in essence, creating a cartoon out of an image. This made use of the excellent [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) and involved two distinct stages - extracting the edges from the image and overlaying them on a copy of the original image that uses a reduced set of colours.
