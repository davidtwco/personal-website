Since October 2017, I've been a regular contributor to the Rust compiler. I'm a member of the [NLL](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/working-groups/nll), [async/await](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/working-groups/async-await) and [diagnostics](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/working-groups/diagnostics) working groups and co-lead the [meta working group](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/working-groups/meta). I've also implemented [RFC 2008](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2008-non-exhaustive.md) and [the edition changes for eRFC 2497](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2497-if-let-chains.md#rollout-plan-and-transitioning-to-rust-2018). In August 2018, I was granted merge privileges to the compiler for significant regular contributions - this responsibility includes being part of the rotation to be assigned incoming PRs for review. In February 2019, I attended the Rust All Hands event in Berlin where team members and invited contributors plan for the year ahead.
