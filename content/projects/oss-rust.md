Since October 2017, I've been a regular contributor to the Rust compiler. I'm a member of Rust's
compiler team (as a [compiler team contributor][contributor], a stepping stone to full team
membership), a co-lead of the [meta working group][meta] and a member of the [NLL][nll],
[async/await][async_await] and [diagnostics][diagnostics] working groups. In February 2019,
I attended the Rust All Hands event in Berlin where team members and invited contributors plan for
the year ahead. My contributions have included implementing
[the `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute from RFC 2008][rfc_2008] and
[the edition changes for eRFC 2497][erfc_2497].
