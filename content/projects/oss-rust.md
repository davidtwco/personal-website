Since October 2017, I've been contributing regularly to Rust's compiler. As a member of the NLL working group, I've worked on various diagnostic and performance improvements as well as some work on soundness and completeness. I've also been involved in implementation of some RFCs - such as RFC 2008 and the edition changes for eRFC 2497. In addition to NLL and RFC contributions, I've made various smaller contributions including changes to the compiletest tool and compiler documentation deployment. In August 2018, I was granted merge privileges to the compiler for significant regular contributions - this responsibility includes being part of the rotation to be assigned incoming PRs for review.
