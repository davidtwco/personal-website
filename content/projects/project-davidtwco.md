New, improved personal website featuring projects and writings. The goal was to make something that was simple, fast and required little-to-no maintenance while still being flexible enough to be built upon in future.

The finished site is built using the [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io) static site generator and is built as part of a [Gulp 4](https://gulpjs.com) pipeline then deployed on Netlify.
