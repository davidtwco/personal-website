During 2016, I developed a website for a video game fan site Relay. In this project, I worked with the staff at Relay to create a performant, easy-to-maintain site that could easily be built upon with more advanced functionality.

A major component of this project was a news search system - I integrated Algolia's Hosted Search into the website - allowing for seamless indexing from the CMS administration panel that resulted in a instant search system for the visitors, complete with multi-facet filtering. Relay's new website launched in November of 2016 to great feedback from the staff and their fans.
