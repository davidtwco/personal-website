I’m a experienced fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Glasgow. I also took Mathematics and Statistics in my first year and continued with Mathematics in my second year. I was also awarded the “Best Computing Science Student Intending Single Honours” award for my performance in first year. As my degree's fourth year, I spent a year working at Codeplay Software.
