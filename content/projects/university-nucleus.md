During my second year Web App Development 2 module, I had to complete a group project to develop a web app using Django. My group identified the need for an application to streamline the automated marking of an earlier assignment in the course.

Our completed application made use of Django, Docker, Gulp and Django Channels and far exceeded the requirements of the project. In particular, I was involved in developing the testing process, including but not limited to the container that runs the tests; the task system that queues test runs; the container that deploys the actual application and a simple easy-to-use configuration for easy testing.
