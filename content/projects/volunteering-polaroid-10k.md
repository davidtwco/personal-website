I created a system that helped streamline the process of assigning race numbers to the runners, provided reports and helped to correct and highlight errors.

Additionally I volunteered on the race nights, by creating a web-based application to quickly and easily identify runners and distribute race numbers to be collected.

After this volunteering experience, I was approached to do further work with the company on the projects previously listed.
